# Course Notes

Typescript is created at Microsoft used to address the shortcommings of Javascript 

TS: Adds these features 
- Static Typing --> important one
- Code completion 
- Refactoring 
- Shorthand notations



Static Means that variables are noticed at compile time. Like no "Hoisting"  -- C++, C#, JAVA -- type is determined
Dynamic Means that variablles are noticed at runtime , and can change soo there is "Hoisting"  -- JS, Python, Ruby -- type is not determined 

# Typesctipt is basically js with typecheking


# Drawbacks of Typescripts :  
Compilations -- we have to give our TS file to compiler , we call this Transpilation  
Disciplined in coding
